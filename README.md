# Testing Framework Quickstart Guide

Welcome to this project's testing framework quickstart! This guide provides you with the essential information needed to get started with writing and running tests for our project.

## Quick Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (adjust based on your project's dependency management tool).
2. **Running Tests**: To run tests, execute `pytest` in the root directory of our project (adjust based on your testing framework).

## Writing New Tests

- Place your test files in the `tests/` directory.
- Name your test files following this pattern: `test_<feature>.py`.
- Use assertions to validate test conditions.

## CI Pipeline

Our tests automatically run on all branches upon commits and pull requests via our CI pipeline. See our [CI Pipeline Configuration](link-to-your-ci-config-file) for details.
